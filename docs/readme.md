# ODSOFT Template Project

## How to generate the svg files

These templates use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) to generate the diagrams that are displayed in the readme. You may use any tool you choose.

If you want to use PlantUML, on project root folder, run the following script:

**For Linux or MacOS**
```shell
$ bin/generate-plantuml-diagrams.sh
```
**For Windows**
```powershell
.\bin\generate-plantuml-diagrams.bat
```
